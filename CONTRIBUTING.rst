We love our community’s interest in the SDV ecosystem. The SDV software 
(and its related libraries) is owned and maintained by DataCebo, Inc. 
It is available under the `Business Source License`_ for you to browse.

We support a large set of users with enterprise-specific intricacies and 
reliability needs. This has required us to be deliberate about setting 
the roadmap for SDV libraries. As a result, we are unable to prioritize 
reviewing and accepting external pull requests. As a policy, we will 
not be able to accept external contributions.

**Would you like a bug or feature request to be addressed?** If you haven't 
already, we would greatly appreciate it if you could `file an issue`_ 
instead with the overall description of your problem. We can determine 
whether it’s aligned with our framework. Once discussed, our team 
typically resolves smaller issues within a few release cycles. 
We appreciate your understanding.
