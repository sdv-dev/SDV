## v1.14.0 - 2024-06-13

This release provides a number of new features. A big one is that it adds the ability to fit the `HMASynthesizer` on disconnected schemas! It also enables the `PARSynthesizer` to work with constraints in certain conditions. More specifically, the `PARSynthesizer` can now handle constraints as long as the columns involved in the constraints are either exclusively all context columns or exclusively all non-context columns.

Additionally, a `verbose` parameter was added to the `TVAESynthesizer` to get a more detailed progress bar. Also, a bug was corrected that renamed the `file_path` parameter in the `ExcelHandler.read()` method to `filepath` as specified in the official [SDV docs](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/multi-table-data/data-preparation/loading-data/excel#read).

# 1.13.1 - 2024-05-16

This release fixes the `ModuleNotFoundError` error that was causing the 1.13.0 release to fail.

## 1.13.0 - 2024-05-15

This release adds a utility function called `get_random_subset` that helps users get a subset of their multi-table data so that modeling can be done quicker. Given a dictionary of table names mapped to DataFrames, metadata, a main table and a desired number of rows to use for the main table, it will subsample the data in a way that maintains referential integrity.

This release also adds two new local file handlers: the `CSVHandler` and the `ExcelHandler`. This enables users to easily load from and save synthetic data to these files types. These handlers return data and metadata in the multi-table format, so we also added the function `get_table_metadata` to get a `SingleTableMetadata` object from a `MultiTableMetadata` object.

Finally, this release fixes some bugs that prevented synthesizers from working with data that had numerical column names.

### New Features

## 1.12.1 - 2024-04-19

This release makes a number of changes to how id columns are generated. By default, id columns with a regex will now have their values scrambled in the output. Id columns without a regex that are numeric will be created randomly. If they're not numeric, they will have a random suffix.

Additionally, improvements were made to the visibility of the `get_loss_values_plot`.

## 1.12.0 - 2024-04-16

This release adds support for Python 3.12! It also adds a number of feature improvements. It adds a `simplify_schema` utility function to the `sdv.utils.poc` module which simplifies multi-table schemas so they can be run using `HMASynthesizer`. Multi-table data dictionaries can now be saved directly to CSVs using the `sdv.datasets.local.save_csvs` utility function. Additionally, generator-discriminator loss values can now be plotted directly from CTGAN using the `get_loss_values_plot` method. This release also adds error messages when trying to load an SDV synthesizer on an older version of the SDV, or when trying to re-fit a synthesizer from an older version of the SDV.

This release also fixes a number of bugs. Metadata auto-detection now validates that all primary keys are unique, and the metadata correctly validates sdtypes in a column relationship. Bugs in the `HMASynthesizer` that would cause the diagnostic score to not be equal to 1.0 for cardinality and data validity were fixed. Finally, errors in constraints now correctly raise a `ConstraintsNotMetError` instead of an `InvalidData` error.

## 1.11.0 - 2024-03-21

This release adds the `poc` utility submodule to help users more easily create a proof-of-concept with multi-table datasets. The `poc` submodule includes the `drop_unknown_references` utility function to automatically drop unknown references in a multi-table dataset. Additionally, multiple columns in the metadata can now be updated at once using the `update_columns` and `update_columns_metadata` methods. The SDV now also warns users when a synthesizer is loaded that was fitted on a different version of the SDV.

## 1.10.0 - 2024-02-15

This release adds multiple improvements to handling premium transformers and column relationships, including using premium transformers even if the PII flag is set to true. Additionally, the SDV now warns users to save the metadata after auto-detection has been used. Semantic sdtype detection has also been improved to tokenize column names to prevent unexpected substring matches.

This release also fixes a few warning bugs and fixes an issue that would cause `metadata.to_dict` to fail for metadata loaded from older versions of the SDV. A few synthesizer bugs were also resolved. The quality of the sequence_index for the `PARSynthesizer` has been improved, and an issue that would cause `CTGANSynthesizer`, `TVAESynthesizer`, and `CopulaGANSynthesizer` to crash if all columns were to be generated from scratch has been fixed.

## 1.9.0 - 2024-01-11

This release makes a number of improvements. It introduces a new concept to the metadata known as column relationships! Column relationships can be used to define when certain groups of columns in a table should be treated as a special concept (eg. address). You can add a column relationship by using the new `add_column_relationship` method. The metadata detection was also improved by allowing semantic sdtypes (eg. 'email', 'phone_number') to be detected as primary keys.

This release also patches some bugs. An issue messing up the likelihood matching in the `HMASynthesizer` was resolved. The `CTGANSynthesizer` no longer fails when using the `FixedCombinations` constraint. The `Inequality` constraint was also patched to handle datetimes better.

### Deprecations

* The `set_address_columns` method is deprecated in favor of `add_column_relationship`.

## 1.8.0 - 2023-12-05

This release adds support for the new Diagnostic Report from SDMetrics. This report calculates scores for three basic but important properties of your data: data validity, data structure and in the multi table case, relationship validity. Data validity checks that the columns of your data are valid (eg. correct range or values). Data structure makes sure the synthetic data has the correct columns. Relationship validity checks to make sure key references are correct and the cardinality is within ranges seen in the real data.

Additionally, a few bugs were fixed and functionality was improved around synthesizers. It is now possible to access the loss values for the `TVAESynthesizer` and `CTGANSynthesizer` by using the `get_loss_values` method. The `get_parameters` method is now more detailed and returns all the parameters used to make a synthesizer. The metadata is now capable of detecting some common pii sdtypes. Finally, a bug that made every parent row generated by the `HMASynthesizer` have at least one child row was patched. This should improve cardinality.

## 1.7.0 - 2023-11-16

This release adds an alert to the `CTGANSynthesizer` during preprocessing. The alert informs the user if the fitting of the synthesizer is likely to be slow on their schema. Additionally, it is now possible to enforce that sampled datetime values stay within the range of the fitted data!

This release also makes internal changes to support address data in SDV Enterprise.

## 1.6.0 - 2023-11-07

This release improves user messaging in multiple ways. The most notable is that users will now see an alert if the `HMASynthesizer` is likely to be slow for their data's schema. Additionally, the logger messaging for constraints and the error messaging when setting distributions on non-parametric models was made more detailed.

The visualization plots in the `sdv.evaluation` sub-package all got a new parameter called `plot_type`, allowing the users to specify the plot type to use if the one being inferred is not useful. The `sdv.datasets.local.load_csvs` method now has a parameter called `read_csv_parameters`, that allow users to specify how the csvs should be read during loading. The same change was also made to the `sdv.metadata.multi_table.detect_table_from_csv`, `sdv.metadata.multi_table.detect_from_csvs`  and `sdv.metadata.single_table.detect_from_csv` methods.

Multiple bugs were resolved including one that caused new categories to be created during the sample step of `CTGANSynthesizer`.

## 1.5.0 - 2023-10-13

Several improvements and bug fixes were made in this release. Most notably, the metadata detection was substantially improved. Support for the 'unknown' sdtype was added, providing more flexibility in data representation. The software now attempts to intelligently detect primary keys and identify parent-child relationships in the metadata, streamlining the metadata creation process.

Additionally, issues related to conditional sampling with negative float values, the inability to update transformers for columns created by constraints, and compatibility with numpy version 1.25 and higher were addressed. The default branch was also switched from 'master' to 'main' for better development practices. Various bugs and errors, including those involving HMA and datetime format detection, were also resolved.

## 1.4.0 - 2023-08-23

This release makes multiple improvements to the metadata. Both the single and multi table metadata classes now have a `validate_data` method. This method runs checks to validate the data against the current specifications in the metadata. The `SingleTableMetadata.visualize` is also improved. The sequence index is now shown in the same section as the sequence key. It also now shows all key and index information (eg. sequence key, primary key, sequence index) in one section.

The `CTGANSynthesizer` has been made more efficient in the following ways:
1. Boolean columns are now being skipped during `preprocess` like categorial columns are.
2. It is possible to apply other transformations to categorical columns and have `CTGAN` skip the one-hot encoding step.

Additional changes include that the columns labeled with the sdtype `id` will now go through the `IDGenerator` transformer by default and constraint transformations that were being overwritten during sampling will now be respected.

### New Features

* Add validate_data method to Metadata - Issue [#1518](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1518) by @fealho
* Use IDGenerator for ID columns - Issue [#1519](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/1519) by @frances-h

## 1.3.0 - 2023-08-14

This release adds two new methods to the `MultiTableMetadata`: `detect_from_csvs` and `detect_From_dataframes`. These methods allow you to detect metadata for a whole dataset at once by either loading them from a folder or a dictionary mapping table names to the `pandas.DataFrames`. The `SingleTableMetadata` can now be visualized! Additionally, there is now a `summarized` option in the `show_table_details` parameter of the `visualize` methods. This will print each sdtype in the table and the number of columns that have that sdtype.

Additionally, this release patches a bug that prevented custom constraints from working on columns that were primary or alternate keys. It also adds support for Python 3.11!

## 1.2.0 - 2023-06-07

This release adds a parameter called `verbose` to the `HMASynthesizer`. Setting it to True will show progress bars during the fitting steps. Additionally, performance optimizations were made to the modeling and initialization of the `HMASynthesizer`.

Multiple changes were made to enhance constraints. The `Range` constraint was improved to be able to generate more accurate data when null values are provided. Constraints are also now validated against the data when running `validate()` on any synthesizer.

Finally, some warnings were resolved.

### New Features

## 1.1.0 - 2023-05-10

This release adds a new initialization parameter to synthesizers called `locales` that allows users to set the locales to use for all columns that have a locale based `sdtype` (eg. `address` or `phone_number`). Additionally, it adds support for Pandas 2.0!

Multiple enhancements were made to improve the performance of data and metadata validation in synthesizers. The `Inequality` constraint was improved to be able to generate more scenarios of data concerning the presence of NaNs. Finally, many warnings have been resolved.

## 1.0.1 - 2023-04-20

This release improves the `load_custom_constraint_classes` method by removing the `table_name` parameter and just loading the constraint
for all tables instead. It also improves some error messages as well as removes some of the warnings that have been surfacing.

Support for sdtypes is enhanced by resolving a bug that was incorrecttly specifying Faker functions for some of them. Support for datetime formats has also been improved. Finally, the `path` argument in some `save` and `load` methods was changed to `filepath` for consistency.

## 1.0.0 - 2023-03-28

This is a major release that introduces a new API to the `SDV` aimed at streamlining the process of synthetic data generation! To achieve this, this release includes the addition of several large features.

### Metadata

Some of the most notable additions are the new `SingleTableMetadata` and `MultiTableMetadata` classes. These classes enable a number of features that make it easier to synthesize your data correctly such as:

* Automatic data detection - Calling `metadata.detect_from_dataframe()` or `metadata.detect_from_csv()` will populate the metadata autonomously with values it thinks represent the data.
* Easy updating - Once an instance of the metadata is created, values can be easily updated using a number of methods defined in the API. For more info, view the [docs](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/data-preparation/single-table-metadata-api).
* Metadata validation - Calling `metadata.validate()` will return a report of any invalid definitions in the metadata specification.
* Upgrading - Users with the previous metadata format can easily update to the new specification using the `upgrade_metadata()` method.
* Saving and loading - The metadata itself can easily be saved to a json file and loaded back up later.

### Class and Module Names

Another major change is the renaming of our core modeling classes and modules. The name changes are meant to highlight the difference between the underlying machine learning models, and the objects responsible for the end-to-end workflow of generating synthetic data. The main name changes are as follows:
* `tabular` -> `single_table`
* `relational` -> `multi_table`
* `timeseries` -> `sequential`
* `BaseTabularModel` -> `BaseSingleTableSynthesizer`
* `GaussianCopula` -> `GaussianCopulaSynthesizer`
* `CTGAN` -> `CTGANSynthesizer`
* `TVAE` -> `TVAESynthesizer`
* `CopulaGan` -> `CopulaGANSynthesizer`
* `PAR` -> `PARSynthesizer`
* `HMA1` -> `HMASynthesizer`

In `SDV` 1.0, synthesizers are classes that take in metadata and handle data preprocessing, model training and model sampling. This is similar to the previous `BaseTabularModel` in `SDV` <1.0.

### Synthetic Data Workflow

`Synthesizers` in `SDV` 1.0 define a clear workflow for generating synthetic data.
1. Synthesizers are initialized with a metadata class.
2. They can then be used to transform the data and apply constraints using the `synthesizer.preprocess()` method. This step also validates that the data matches the provided metadata to avoid errors in fitting or sampling.
3. The processed data can then be fed into the underlying machine learning model using `synthesizer.fit_processed_data()`. (Alternatively, data can be preprocessed and fit to the model using `synthesizer.fit()`.)
4. Data can then be sampled using `synthesizer.sample()`.

Each synthesizer class also provides a series of methods to help users customize the transformations their data goes through. Read more about that [here](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/modeling/synthetic-data-workflow/transform-and-anonymize).

Notice that the preprocessing and model fitting steps can now be separated. This can be helpful if preprocessing is time consuming or if the data has been processed externally.

### Other Highly Requested Features

Another major addition is control over randomization. In `SDV` <1.0, users could set a seed to control the randomization for only some columns. In `SDV` 1.0, randomization is controlled for all columns. Every new call to sample generates new data, but the synthesizer's seed can be reset to the original state using `synthesizer.reset_randomization()`, enabling reproducibility.

`SDV 1.0` adds accessibility and transparency into the transformers used for preprocessing and underlying machine learning models.
* Using the `synthesizer.get_transformers()` method, you can access the transformers used to preprocess each column and view their properties. This can be useful for debugging and accessing privacy information like mappings used to mask data.
* Distribution parameters learned by copula models can be accessed using the `synthesizer.get_learned_distributions()` method.

PII handling is improved by the following features:
* Primary keys can be set to natural sdtypes (eg. SSN, email, name). Previously they could only be numerical or text.
* The `PseudoAnonymizedFaker` can be used to provide consistent mapping to PII columns. As mentioned before, the mapping itself can be accessed by viewing the transformers for the column using `synthesizer.get_transformers()`.
* A bug causing PII columns to slow down modeling is patched.

Finally, the synthetic data can now be easily evaluated using the `evaluate_quality()` and `run_diagnostic()` methods. The data can be compared visually to the actual data using the `get_column_plot()` and `get_column_pair_plot()` methods. For more info on how to visualize or interpret the synthetic data evaluation, read the docs [here](https://docs.sdv.dev/sdv/single-table-data/evaluation).

## 0.16.0 - 2022-07-21

This release brings user friendly improvements and bug fixes on the `SDV` constraints, to help
users generate their synthetic data easily.

Some predefined constraints have been renamed and redefined to be more user friendly & consistent.
The custom constraint API has also been updated for usability. The SDV now automatically determines
the best `handling_strategy` to use for each constraint, attempting `transform` by default and
falling back to `reject_sampling` otherwise. The `handling_strategy` parameters are no longer
included in the API.

Finally, this version of `SDV` also unifies the parameters for all sampling related methods for
all models (including TabularPreset).

### Changes to Constraints

* `GreatherThan` constraint is now separated in two new constraints: `Inequality`, which is
  intended to be used between two columns, and `ScalarInequality`, which is intended to be used
  between a column and a scalar.

* `Between` constraint is now separated in two new constraints: `Range`, which is intended to
  be used between three columns, and `ScalarRange`, which is intended to be used between a column
  and low and high scalar values.

* `FixedIncrements` a new constraint that makes the data increment by a certain value.
* New `create_custom_constraint` function available to create custom constraints.

### Removed Constraints
* `Rounding` Rounding is automatically being handled by the ``rdt.HyperTransformer``.
* `ColumnFormula` the `create_custom_constraint` takes place over this one and allows more
  advanced usage for the end users.

### Issues resolved

* Conditionally sampling on variable in constraint should have variety for other variables - Issue [#440](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/440) by @amontanez24

## 0.10.0 - 2021-05-21

This release improves the constraint functionality by allowing constraints and conditions
at the same time. Additional changes were made to update tutorials.

### Issues resolved

* Not able to use constraints and conditions in the same time - Issue [#379](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/379)
by @amontanez24
* Update benchmarking user guide for reading private datasets - Issue [#427](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/427)
by @katxiao

## 0.9.1 - 2021-04-29

This release broadens the constraint functionality by allowing for the `ColumnFormula`
constraint to take lambda functions and returned functions as an input for its formula.

It also improves conditional sampling by ensuring that any `id` fields generated by the
model remain unique throughout the sampled data.

The `CTGAN` model was improved by adjusting a default parameter to be more mathematically
correct.

Additional changes were made to improve tutorials as well as fix fragile tests.

## 0.9.0 - 2021-03-31

This release brings new privacy metrics to the evaluate framework which help to determine
if the real data could be obtained or deduced from the synthetic samples.
Additionally, now there is a normalized score for the metrics, which stays between `0` and `1`.

There are improvements that reduce the usage of memory ram when sampling new data. Also there
is a new parameter to control the reject sampling crash, `graceful_reject_sampling`, which if
set to `True` and if it's not possible to generate all the requested rows, it will just issue a
warning and return whatever it was able to generate.

The `Metadata` object can now be visualized using different combinations of `names` and `details`,
which can be set to `True` or `False` in order to display only the table names with details or
without. There is also an improvement on the `validation`, which now will display all the errors
found at the end of the validation instead of only the first one.

This version also exposes all the hyperparameters of the models `CTGAN` and `TVAE` to allow a more
advanced usage. There is also a fix for the `TVAE` model on small datasets and it's performance
with `NaN` values has been improved. There is a fix for when using
`UniqueCombinationConstraint` with the `transform` strategy.

## 0.8.0 - 2021-02-24

This version adds conditional sampling for tabular models by combining a reject-sampling
strategy with the native conditional sampling capabilities from the gaussian copulas.

It also introduces several upgrades on the HMA1 algorithm that improve data quality and
robustness in the multi-table scenarios by making changes in how the parameters of the child
tables are aggregated on the parent tables, including a complete rework of how the correlation
matrices are modeled and rebuild after sampling.

### Issues resolved

This release introduces a few changes in the HMA1 relational algorithm to decrease modeling
and sampling times, while also ensuring that correlations are properly kept across tables
and also adding support for some relational schemas that were not supported before.

A few changes in constraints and tabular models also ensure that situations that produced
errors before now work without errors.

## 0.6.0 - 2020-12-22

This release updates to the latest CTGAN, RDT and SDMetrics libraries to introduce a
new TVAE model, multiple new metrics for single table and multi table, and fixes
issues in the re-creation of tabular models from a metadata dict.

### Issues resolved

* Upgrade to SDMetrics v0.1.0 and add `sdv.metrics` module - [Issue #281](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/281) by @csala
* Upgrade to CTGAN 0.3.0 and add TVAE model - [Issue #278](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/278) by @fealho

## 0.5.0 - 2020-11-25

This version updates the dependencies and makes a few internal changes in order
to ensure that SDV works properly on Windows Systems, making this the first
release to be officially supported on Windows.

Apart from this, some more internal changes have been made to solve a few minor
issues from the older versions while also improving the processing speed when
processing relational datasets with the default parameters.

### API breaking changes

* The `distribution` argument of the `GaussianCopula` has been renamed to `field_distributions`.
* The `HMA1` and `SDV` classes now use the `categorical_fuzzy` transformer by default instead of
  the `one_hot_encoding` one.

### Issues resolved

* GaussianCopula: rename `distribution` argument to `field_distributions` - [Issue #237](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/237) by @csala
* GaussianCopula: Improve error message if an invalid distribution name is passed - [Issue #220](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/220) by csala

* Integer categoricals being sampled as strings instead of integer values - [Issue #194](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/194) by @csala

## 0.4.5 - 2020-10-17

In this version a new family of models for Synthetic Time Series Generation is introduced
under the `sdv.timeseries` sub-package. The new family of models now includes a new class
called `PAR`, which implements a *Probabilistic AutoRegressive* model.

This version also adds support for composite primary keys and regex based generation of id
fields in tabular models and drops Python 3.5 support.

### Issues resolved

* Drop python 3.5 support - [Issue #204](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/204) by @csala
* Support composite primary keys in tabular models - [Issue #207](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/207) by @csala
* Add the option to generate string `id` fields based on regex on tabular models - [Issue #208](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/208) by @csala
* Synthetic Time Series - [Issue #142](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/142) by @csala


## 0.4.4 - 2020-10-06

This version adds a new tabular model based on combining the CTGAN model with the reversible
transformation applied in the GaussianCopula model that converts random variables with
arbitrary distributions to new random variables with standard normal distribution.

The reversible transformation is handled by the GaussianCopulaTransformer recently added to RDT.

### Issues resolved

* Add CopulaGAN Model - [Issue #202](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/202) by @csala

## 0.4.3 - 2020-09-28

This release moves the models and algorithms related to generation of synthetic
relational data to a new `sdv.relational` subpackage (Issue #198)

As part of the change, also the old `sdv.models` have been removed and now
relational model is based on the recently introduced `sdv.tabular` models.

## 0.4.2 - 2020-09-19

In this release the `sdv.evaluation` module has been reworked to include 4 different
metrics and in all cases return a normalized score between 0 and 1.

Included metrics are:
- `cstest`
- `kstest`
- `logistic_detection`
- `svc_detection`

## 0.4.1 - 2020-09-07

This release fixes a couple of minor issues and introduces an important rework of the
User Guides section of the documentation.

### Issues fixed

* Error Message: "make sure the Graphviz executables are on your systems' PATH" - [Issue #182](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/182) by @csala
* Anonymization mappings leak - [Issue #187](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/187) by @csala

## 0.4.0 - 2020-08-08

In this release SDV gets new documentation, new tutorials, improvements to the Tabular API
and broader python and dependency support.

Complete list of changes:

* New Documentation site based on the `pydata-sphinx-theme`.
* New User Guides and Notebook tutorials.
* New Developer Guides section within the docs with details about the SDV architecture,
  the ecosystem libraries and how to extend and contribute to the project.
* Improved API for the Tabular models with focus on ease of use.
* Support for Python 3.8 and the newest versions of pandas, scipy and scikit-learn.
* New Slack Workspace for development discussions and community support.

## 0.3.6 - 2020-07-23

This release introduces a new concept of `Constraints`, which allow the user to define
special relationships between columns that will not be handled via modeling.

This is done via a new `sdv.constraints` subpackage which defines some well-known pre-defined
constraints, as well as a generic framework that allows the user to customize the constraints
to their needs as much as necessary.

### New Features

* Support for Constraints - [Issue #169](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/169) by @csala


## 0.3.5 - 2020-07-09

This release introduces a new subpackage `sdv.tabular` with models designed specifically
for single table modeling, while still providing all the usual conveniences from SDV, such
as:

* Seamless multi-type support
* Missing data handling
* PII anonymization

Currently implemented models are:

* GaussianCopula: Multivariate distributions modeled using copula functions. This is stronger
  version, with more marginal distributions and options, than the one used to model multi-table
  datasets.
* CTGAN: GAN-based data synthesizer that can generate synthetic tabular data with high fidelity.
