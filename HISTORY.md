# Release Notes

## 0.11.0 - 2021-07-12

This release primarily addresses bugs and feature requests related to using constraints for the single-table models.
Users can now enforce scalar comparison with the existing `GreaterThan` constraint and apply 5 new constraints: `OneHotEncoding`, `Positive`, `Negative`, `Between` and `Rounding`.
Additionally, the SDV will now auto-apply constraints for rounding numerical values, and for keeping the data within the observed bounds.
All related user guides are updated with the new functionality.

## 0.10.1 - 2021-06-10

This release changes the way we sample conditions to not only group by the conditions passed by the user, but also by the transformed conditions that result from them.

### Issues resolved

* Conditionally sampling on variable in constraint should have variety for other variables - Issue [#440](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/440) by @amontanez24

## 0.10.0 - 2021-05-21

This release improves the constraint functionality by allowing constraints and conditions
at the same time. Additional changes were made to update tutorials.

* Not able to use constraints and conditions in the same time - Issue [#379](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/379)
by @amontanez24
* Update benchmarking user guide for reading private datasets - Issue [#427](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/427)
by @katxiao

## 0.9.1 - 2021-04-29

This release broadens the constraint functionality by allowing for the `ColumnFormula`
constraint to take lambda functions and returned functions as an input for its formula.

It also improves conditional sampling by ensuring that any `id` fields generated by the
model remain unique throughout the sampled data.

The `CTGAN` model was improved by adjusting a default parameter to be more mathematically
correct.

Additional changes were made to improve tutorials as well as fix fragile tests.

* Request for sdv.constraint.ColumnFormula for a wider range of function - Issue [#373](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/373) by @amontanez24 and @JetfiRex

## 0.9.0 - 2021-03-31

This release brings new privacy metrics to the evaluate framework which help to determine
if the real data could be obtained or deduced from the synthetic samples.
Additionally, now there is a normalized score for the metrics, which stays between `0` and `1`.

There are improvements that reduce the usage of memory ram when sampling new data. Also there
is a new parameter to control the reject sampling crash, `graceful_reject_sampling`, which if
set to `True` and if it's not possible to generate all the requested rows, it will just issue a
warning and return whatever it was able to generate.

The `Metadata` object can now be visualized using different combinations of `names` and `details`,
which can be set to `True` or `False` in order to display only the table names with details or
without. There is also an improvement on the `validation`, which now will display all the errors
found at the end of the validation instead of only the first one.

This version also exposes all the hyperparameters of the models `CTGAN` and `TVAE` to allow a more
advanced usage. There is also a fix for the `TVAE` model on small datasets and it's performance
with `NaN` values has been improved. There is a fix for when using
`UniqueCombinationConstraint` with the `transform` strategy.

### Issues resolved

## 0.8.0 - 2021-02-24

This version adds conditional sampling for tabular models by combining a reject-sampling
strategy with the native conditional sampling capabilities from the gaussian copulas.

It also introduces several upgrades on the HMA1 algorithm that improve data quality and
robustness in the multi-table scenarios by making changes in how the parameters of the child
tables are aggregated on the parent tables, including a complete rework of how the correlation
matrices are modeled and rebuild after sampling.

### Issues resolved

## 0.7.0 - 2021-01-27

This release introduces a few changes in the HMA1 relational algorithm to decrease modeling
and sampling times, while also ensuring that correlations are properly kept across tables
and also adding support for some relational schemas that were not supported before.

A few changes in constraints and tabular models also ensure that situations that produced
errors before now work without errors.

to ensure that SDV works properly on Windows Systems, making this the first
release to be officially supported on Windows.

Apart from this, some more internal changes have been made to solve a few minor
issues from the older versions while also improving the processing speed when
processing relational datasets with the default parameters.

### API breaking changes

* The `distribution` argument of the `GaussianCopula` has been renamed to `field_distributions`.

## 0.4.5 - 2020-10-17

In this version a new family of models for Synthetic Time Series Generation is introduced
under the `sdv.timeseries` sub-package. The new family of models now includes a new class

This version also adds support for composite primary keys and regex based generation of id
fields in tabular models and drops Python 3.5 support.

## 0.4.4 - 2020-10-06

transformation applied in the GaussianCopula model that converts random variables with
arbitrary distributions to new random variables with standard normal distribution.

The reversible transformation is handled by the GaussianCopulaTransformer recently added to RDT.

### Issues resolved

* Add CopulaGAN Model - [Issue #202](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/202) by @csala

## 0.4.3 - 2020-09-28

This release moves the models and algorithms related to generation of synthetic
relational data to a new `sdv.relational` subpackage (Issue #198)

As part of the change, also the old `sdv.models` have been removed and now
relational model is based on the recently introduced `sdv.tabular` models.

## 0.4.2 - 2020-09-19

In this release the `sdv.evaluation` module has been reworked to include 4 different
metrics and in all cases return a normalized score between 0 and 1.

Included metrics are:

- `kstest`
- `logistic_detection`
- `svc_detection`

## 0.4.1 - 2020-09-07

and broader python and dependency support.

Complete list of changes:

* New Documentation site based on the `pydata-sphinx-theme`.
* New User Guides and Notebook tutorials.
* New Developer Guides section within the docs with details about the SDV architecture,
  the ecosystem libraries and how to extend and contribute to the project.
* Improved API for the Tabular models with focus on ease of use.
* Support for Python 3.8 and the newest versions of pandas, scipy and scikit-learn.
* New Slack Workspace for development discussions and community support.

## 0.3.6 - 2020-07-23

This release introduces a new concept of `Constraints`, which allow the user to define
special relationships between columns that will not be handled via modeling.

This is done via a new `sdv.constraints` subpackage which defines some well-known pre-defined
constraints, as well as a generic framework that allows the user to customize the constraints
to their needs as much as necessary.

### New Features

* Support for Constraints - [Issue #169](https://github.com/sdv-dev/SDV/issues/169) by @csala


## 0.3.5 - 2020-07-09

This release introduces a new subpackage `sdv.tabular` with models designed specifically
for single table modeling, while still providing all the usual conveniences from SDV, such
as:

* Seamless multi-type support
* Missing data handling
* PII anonymization

Currently implemented models are:

* GaussianCopula: Multivariate distributions modeled using copula functions. This is stronger
  version, with more marginal distributions and options, than the one used to model multi-table
  datasets.
* CTGAN: GAN-based data synthesizer that can generate synthetic tabular data with high fidelity.
