Quickstart
==========

In this short tutorial we will guide you through a series of steps that
will help you getting started using **SDV**.

Model the dataset using SDV
---------------------------

To model a multi table, relational dataset, we follow two steps. In the
first step, we will load the data and configures the meta data. In the
second step, we will use the SDV API to fit and save a hierarchical
model. We will cover these two steps in this section using an example
dataset.
