    "# GaussianCopula Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this guide we will go through a series of steps that will let you discover\n",
    "functionalities of the `GaussianCopula` model, including how to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create an instance of a `GaussianCopula`.\n",
    "* Fit the instance to your data.\n",
    "* Generate synthetic versions of your data.\n",
    "* Use the a `GaussianCopula` to anonymize PII information.\n",

    "## What is GaussianCopula?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sdv.tabular.GaussianCopula` model from `SDV` is based on the\n",
    "`copulas.multivariate.GaussianMultivariate` class from the [Copulas library](\n",
    "https://sdv.dev/Copulas), a library for modeling and sampling multivariate distributions\n",
    "based on [copula funtions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copula_%28probability_theory%29).\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical terms, a Gaussian Copula is a distribution over the unit cube\n",
    "${\\displaystyle [0,1]^{d}}$ which is constructed from a multivariate normal distribution over\n",
    "${\\displaystyle \\mathbb {R} ^{d}}$ by using the probability integral transform. Intuitively,\n",
    "a Copula is a mathematical function that allows us to describe the joint distribution of\n",
    "multiple random variables by analyzing the dependencies between their marginal distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now discover how to learn a dataset and later on generate synthetic data with the same\n",
    "format and statistical properties by using the `GaussianCopula` model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Quick Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by loading one of our demo datasets, the `student_placements`, which contains information\n",
    "about MBA students that applied for placements during the year 2020."

    "Models apply [Reversible Data Transforms](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT) under the hood\n",
    "to transform all the non-numerical variables, which the underlying models cannot handle,\n",
    "into numerical representations which they can properly work with. In the case of the\n",
    "`GaussianCopula`, the default transformation is a One-Hot encoding, which can work very\n",
    "well with variables that have a little number of different values, but which is very\n",
    "inefficient in cases where there is a large number of values.\n",

    "* `integer`: Uses a `NumericalTransformer` of dtype `int`.\n",
    "* `float`: Uses a `NumericalTransformer` of dtype `float`.\n",
