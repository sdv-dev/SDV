    "-   Create an instance of `CopulaGAN`.\n",

    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sdv.tabular.CopulaGAN` model is a variation of the\n",
    "[ctgan](ctgan.ipynb) which takes advantage of the CDF\n",
    "based transformation that the GaussianCopulas apply to make the\n",
    "underlying CTGAN model task of learning the data easier.\n",

    "Let\\'s now discover how to learn a dataset and later on generate\n",

    "Quick Usage\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by loading one of our demo datasets, the\n",

    "    probability distributions.\n",
    "3.  Learn the probability distribution of each column from the table\n",
