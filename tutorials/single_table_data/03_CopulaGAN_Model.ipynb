    "-   Create an instance of `CopulaGAN`.\n",
    "-   Fit the instance to your data.\n",

    "What is CopulaGAN?\n",
    "------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sdv.tabular.CopulaGAN` model is a variation of the\n",
    "[ctgan](ctgan.ipynb) which takes advantage of the CDF\n",
    "based transformation that the GaussianCopulas apply to make the\n",
    "underlying CTGAN model task of learning the data easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\\'s now discover how to learn a dataset and later on generate\n",
    "synthetic data with the same format and statistical properties by using\n",
    "the `CopulaGAN` class from SDV.\n",

    "Quick Usage\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by loading one of our demo datasets, the\n",

    "1.  Learn the format and data types of the passed data\n",
    "2.  Transform the non-numerical and null data using [Reversible Data\n",
    "    Transforms](https://github.com/sdv-dev/RDT) to obtain a fully\n",
    "    numerical representation of the data from which we can learn the\n",
    "    probability distributions.\n",
    "3.  Learn the probability distribution of each column from the table\n",
    "4.  Transform the values of each numerical column by converting them to\n",
    "    their marginal distribution CDF values and then applying an inverse\n",
    "    CDF transformation of a standard normal on them.\n",
    "5.  Fit a CTGAN model on the transformed data, which learns how each\n",
    "    column is correlated to the others.\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, when we used the model to generate new data for our table\n",
    "using the `sample` method, it did:\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  Sample rows from the CTGAN model.\n",
    "6.  Revert the sampled values by computing their standard normal CDF and\n",
    "    then applying the inverse CDF of their marginal distributions.\n",
    "7.  Revert the RDT transformations to go back to the original data\n",
    "    format.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, during these steps the *Marginal Probability\n",
