    "\n",
    "-   Create an instance of `TVAE`.\n",
    "-   Fit the instance to your data.\n",
    "-   Generate synthetic versions of your data.\n",

    "What is TVAE?\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `sdv.tabular.TVAE` model is based on the VAE-based Deep Learning\n",
    "data synthesizer which was presented at the NeurIPS 2020 conference by\n",
    "the paper titled [Modeling Tabular data using Conditional\n",
    "GAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.00503).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let\\'s now discover how to learn a dataset and later on generate\n",
    "synthetic data with the same format and statistical properties by using\n",
    "the `TVAE` class from SDV.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick Usage\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "We will start by loading one of our demo datasets, the\n",
