    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "A very common scenario that we face when working with tabular data is\n",
    "finding columns that have very particular relationships between them\n",
    "which are very hard to model and easily confuse the Tabular Models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some simple examples of these scenarios include:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   A table that has the columns `country` and `city`: In such scenario,\n",
    "    it might be very hard to learn which country each city belongs to,\n",
    "    and when sampling probabilistically, the model is likely to end up\n",
    "    generating invalid country/city combinations.\n",
    "-   A table that contains both the `age` and the `date of birth` of a\n",
    "    user. The model will learn the age and date of birth distributions\n",
    "    and mostly generate valid combinations, but in some cases it might\n",
    "    end up giving back ages that do not correspond to the given date of\n",
    "    birth.\n",
    "\n",
    "These kind of special relationships between columns are called\n",
    "`Constraints`, and **SDV** provides a very powerful and flexible\n",
    "mechanism to take them into account and guarantee that the sampled data\n",
    "always respects them.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "**SDV** handles constraints using two different strategies:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transform Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "When using this strategy, **SDV** applies a transformation to the data\n",
    "before learning it in a way that allows the model to better capture the\n",
    "data properties. For example, if we have one column that needs to be\n",
    "always greater than the other one, SDV can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Replace the higher column with the difference between the two\n",
    "    columns, which will always be positive.\n",
    "2.  Model the transformed data and sample new values.\n",
    "3.  Recompute the value of the high column by adding the values of the\n",
    "    lower column to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Transform** strategy is very efficient and does not affect the\n",
    "speed of the modeling and sampling process, but in some cases might\n",
    "affect the quality of the learning process or simply not be possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reject Sampling Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "In the cases where applying a **Transform** strategy is not possible or\n",
    "may affect the quality of the learning process, **SDV** can apply a\n",
    "**Reject Sampling** strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using this strategy, **SDV** validates the sampled rows, discards\n",
    "the ones that do not adjust to the constraint, and re-samples them. This\n",
    "process is repeated until enough rows have been sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining Constraints\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
