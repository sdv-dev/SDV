    "## What is PAR?\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PAR` class is an implementation of a Probabilitic AutoRegressive model\n",
    "that allows learning **multi-type, multivariate timeseries data** and later\n",
    "on generate new synthetic data that has the same format and properties as\n",
    "the learned one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionaly, the `PAR` model has the ability to generate new synthetic\n",
    "timeseries conditioned on the properties of the entity to which this\n",
    "timeseries data would be associated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",

    "**WARNING**\n",
    "\n",
    "The PAR model is under active development. Please use it, try it on your data\n",

    "    or our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/sdv-space/shared_invite/zt-gdsfcb5w-0QQpFMVoyB2Yd6SRiMplcw)\n",
