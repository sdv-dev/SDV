    "What is PAR?\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The `PAR` class is an implementation of a Probabilistic AutoRegressive\n",
    "model that allows learning **multi-type, multivariate timeseries data**\n",
    "and later on generate new synthetic data that has the same format and\n",
    "properties as the learned one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the `PAR` model has the ability to generate new synthetic\n",
    "timeseries conditioned on the properties of the entity to which this\n",
    "timeseries data would be associated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**\n",
    "\n",
    "The PAR model is under active development. Please use it, try it on your\n",
